# SaitaBot-TS

My Discord bot, developed in TypeScript, using Discord.js.

## Installation

Clone this repository, and install the dependencies by using `npm install ts-node` and `npm install discord.js` (if you are in Windows).
Once everything is installed, you can start the bot by running the index.ts file by using `npx ts-node index.js`.

## Configuration File

There's a hidden file that stores sensitive information, called `config.json` (path: sources/assets).
If you want to run the bot, you must create it inside of the bot's folder.
